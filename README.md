# WhisperBox 🕊️📦

WhisperBox is a private, anonymous real-time chat platform where users can instantly create or join temporary chatrooms without needing to sign up. Each user is assigned a random character name and avatar. Files can be shared, rooms auto-delete after inactivity, and everything stays ephemeral.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎭 **Random Character Identity** — Auto-assigned usernames with avatars.
- 📎 **File Sharing** — Share PDFs, images, docs, and more.
- 🕒 **Auto Expiry** — Rooms self-destruct after 5 minutes of inactivity.
- 🌗 **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** — User-controlled theme.
- 💬 **Join Popups & Typing Indicator** *(optional)* — Get notified when someone joins.
- 🖼️ **Minimalist UI** — Responsive, clean design built with TailwindCSS.
